# Multi-Tier VPC project.  

The goal of this project is to show how to strengthen security by customizing an Amazon VPC, and limit  
exposure to resources in this VPC by making use of a multi-tier architecture.     

I learned about these concepts in the AWS Skill Builder Networking Core course and the challenge for me is to  
translate the diagram (follow link below) into Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using CDK Python.
